Append(): This method is used to add an element to the end of a list.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Extend(): This method is used to add elements of one list to another list.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
another_list = [4, 5, 6]
my_list.extend(another_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Insert(): This method is used to add an element at a specific index in the list.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.insert(1, 4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]

Remove(): This method is used to remove the first occurrence of an element from the list.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
my_list.remove(2)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 2]

Pop(): This method is used to remove and return the last element from the list.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
last_element = my_list.pop()
print(last_element)  # Output: 3
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2]

Index(): This method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of an element in the list.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
index_of_2 = my_list.index(2)
print(index_of_2)  # Output: 1

Count(): This method is used to count the number of times an element appears in the list.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
count_of_2 = my_list.count(2)
print(count_of_2)  # Output: 2

Sort(): This method is used to sort the elements in the list in ascending or descending order.
my_list = [3, 2, 1]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

Reverse(): This method is used to reverse the order of elements in the list.
my_list = [3, 2, 1]
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

Slicing: Slicing is a powerful operation that allows you to extract a portion of a list. For example, you can extract the first three elements of a list using the syntax my_list[0:3].
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
first_three_elements = my_list[0:3]
print(first_three_elements)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
